%   With the data from the ERAU
%   parking committee we can model the transportation methods of ERAU
%   students. We have the data for each studentâ€™s travel mode (car, bike,
%   walk, skate), whether the student lives on campus, if they own a car and
%   the current cost of parking pass, if they own a bike with registration
%   and the cost of registration, and also if they own a skateboard. We can
%   calculate accurate percentages of transportation methods with this data,
%   because the students disclose whether it is their only transportation or
%   if they have multiple. Some data to be considered is location of their
%   dorm because that can affect their preferred transportation method
%   depending on their distance to their class and will help the model better
%   predict the students that did not participate in the sample size. The
%   sample size will also affect the accuracy of the model.

%Chance Values
%   chance values are determined from ratios in the datamodle, which i
%   converted to percentage values
