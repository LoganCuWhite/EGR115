 Create a variable named intvar that is hardcoded with an integer, displaying the value of the variable when the program is run by
omitting the semicolon on the line of code where the assignment was made. Describe what is actually occurring inside the computer when
this line of code is run but do not describe it in terms of variables; rather, describe it in terms of memory, transistors, bits, etc
%}

%DEFINE itvar as an integer
itvar = 7

%{ 
 answer the question 
 When the semi colon is ommited from the varable the output of the line is
 no longer suppressed from the console, and thus is shown when the code is
 run
