 Make a copy of #4. Reverse the code line so that my_answer 
 is on the right side of the equal sign and the code originally 
 on the right side is now on the left side of the equal sign.

addend = 30;
my_number = 39;
my_number+addend = my_answer

%{
  Changing "my_answer = my_number+addend" to 
  "my_number+addend = my_answer" has no effect because mathmatically
  it is the same just like "2+2=4" is the same as "4=2+2"
