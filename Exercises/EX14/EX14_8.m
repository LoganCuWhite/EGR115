 Hardcode the variable item1 with an integer that is less than 50.
 Hardcode the variable item2 with a different integer less than 50.
 Swap the two values between the variables: Create a variable temp
 by assigning the variable item1 to it. This saves the value that
 is in item1 by copying it to temp. Next, assign the variable item2
 to the variable item1 â€“ this saves the value in item2 in the 
 variable item1. Finally, assign the variable temp to item2. After
 performing the swap, display item1 and item2 by placing the 
 variable name seach on a line by itself with no semicolon to see 
 that they have indeed swapped their values.
