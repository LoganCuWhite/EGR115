 Write a MATLAB program that has two hardcoded positive integers stored in
 variables int1 and int2. Collect (i.e. store in a variable) the result of
 applying the mod() function to the two integers (int1 as first argument,3
 int2 as second argument). Report the result of the mod() function by 
 omission of semicolon.
%}

int1 = 13;
int2 = 26;
intmod = mod(int1,int2)
