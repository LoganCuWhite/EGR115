 On paper, re-arrange the mathematical expression in #3 to solve for k â€“ there
 is no need to submit the paper since you will then write a MATLAB program
 that uses MATLAB's log() function and the re-arranged math to compute k, assuming the population
 doubles every five minutes. Have the program display k by omission of 
 semicolon.

t =  5;
intpop = 10;
finpop = intpop*2;
k = (log(finpop/intpop))/t
