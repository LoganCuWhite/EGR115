Write a MATLAB program that uses a WHILE loop to compute this summation.
The loop will look much like #1, only the count will start at 3 and there
will be no input to be added â€“ instead, a value will be computed using the
counting variable, k. Using fprintf(), display T when the loop is complete.

iter = 0;
count = 3;
while count <= 17
    iter = iter + count^2;
    count = count + 1;
end

fprintf('Total... %d\n', iter);
