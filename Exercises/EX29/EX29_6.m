Define the variables str1 as the string "Fred " (with five blank spaces
after the name) and str2 as "Flintstone " (again with five blank spaces
after the name). Concatenate the two together three times: 
(a) making thevariable S6a by using sprintf() to concatenate str1 and str2 
(b) making thevariable S6b by using array concatenation [] to concatenate str1 and str2
(c) making the variable S6c by using the strcat() function to concatenate
    str1 and str2
%}

str1 = 'Fred     ';
str2 = 'Flintstone     ';


S6a = sprintf('%s %s', str1, str2)
S6b =  [str1, str2]
s6c = strcat( str1, str2)

%{
Why is strcat() different â€“ what effect does the function have the other
methods of concatenation do not?
Strcat removes blank characters such as spaces and tabs
